While this DLC doesn’t reinvent the wheel, it offers a solid reason to return to one of this year’s best indie games. It’s a fairly small expansion, but for a budget price you’re getting new mysteries to unravel, new fish to catch and a new area to explore. What more could you want?"},
  {"name": "Oliver Reynolds", "rating": "images/newImage/5star.png","date": "11.22.2023", "text": "Bluey: The Videogame Review: The game successfully emulates the look and feel of the iconic TV show, but unfortunately it fails to recapture the same family magic. The gameplay is incredibly repetitive across the one-to-two-hour experience, relying on locating items dotted around the five core environments. Minigames break up the monotony somewhat, but even these fail to maintain attention for too long. That said, young children are going to get a kick out of simply existing within this world and playing as their favourite Bluey characters. If that's all you're looking to get out of this game, this does a decent job. But when you compare it to the all-ages magic of the show itself, and other family-focused games on Switch, this falls well short of the source material."},
  {"name": "PJ O'Reilly", "rating": "images/newImage/6star.png","date": "11.22.2023", "text": "Jurassic Park Classic Games Collection Review: The Jurassic Park Classic Games Collection serves up seven slices of old-school dino action in a package that suffers from its focus on the 8- and 16-bit eras. Yes, it's great to have these old games all gathered up and available to play with some quality-of-life additions, you can't knock them too hard for being clunky by today's standards, and nostalgia may add a few points to the overall score below if you're an Isla Nublar mega-fan, but there's no avoiding the fact that the experiences here haven't aged particularly well."},
  {"name": "Tom Massey", "rating": "images/newImage/6star.png","date": "11.22.2023", "text": "Irem Collection Volume 1 Review: While its presentation is in some cases downright lacking, the Irem Collection Volume 1's essentials are at least in order, delivering three great games, several port variations, and enough adjustable options to satisfy. That said, both Image Fights are utter taskmasters that require a hardened disposition, and that limits their broader appeal. X Multiply makes up for this by being a lot more accessible, with a visually superb aesthetic, but also feels like the odd one out because of it. We can't help but feel an Irem Collection combining eight to ten titles would have been something worth shouting about, but with further volumes in the pipeline, this does feel like yet another exercise in squeezing a niche consumer base over several releases. Despite our appreciation of the games on board, it's hard to get too excited."},
  {"name": "Adrian Burrows", "rating": "images/newImage/2star.png","date": "11.23.2023", "text": "Flashback 2 Review: Visually, Flashback 2 is a blurry and overly busy mess, with objects blending into each other like an oil painting gone wrong. Nothing stands out, adding to the woes of aiming and shooting. Environments are small and basic, providing no sense of exploration, and that extends to the rather naff story as well, which is presented as nothing more than a series of dull, terribly scripted, poorly-voiced talking heads."},
  {"name": "Oliver Reynolds", "rating": "images/newImage/2star.png","date": "11.23.2023", "text": "The Walking Dead: Destinies Review: Publisher GameMill should be embarrassed at putting out The Walking Dead: Destinies at any price, let alone as a $50 boxed product, and we sincerely hope AMC Networks takes a bit more care in who it entrusts with its IP in the future. There's absolutely nothing here that has been executed well; it's a game that is simply rife with technical blunders, terrible production values, and broken mechanics. The only thing keeping Destinies from achieving a lower score is that you can at least play to the end credits, but even those have been fumbled. In a year filled with bonafide classics, Destinies is the worst game we've played."},
  {"name": "Mitch Vogel", "rating": "images/newImage/7star.png","date": "11.23.2023", "text": "ASTLIBRA Revision Review: Astlibra Revision may not be a truly great game, but it is most certainly an interesting one. At the very least, it is unafraid to challenge JRPG conventions in unique ways while also demonstrating mastery of the genre's most basic tropes. It can feel a little too archaic in its design and haphazard in its pacing, while the vaguely Flash game-esque visuals are a bit of a letdown. On the whole, though, it proves to be a worthwhile experience, one that we would especially recommend to fans of older RPGs. If you can look past its faults, there's a lot to love about Astlibra; we'd suggest you investigate if your interest is piqued."},
  {"name": "Alana Dunitz", "rating": "images/newImage/8star.png","date": "11.25.2023", "text": "Pixel Cafe Review: Pixel Cafe is a great “cosy” game, though at times, it feels like it’s too action-packed to be considered a relaxing and laid-back title. To keep all the customers happy, you will need to have fast reaction times to ensure you get the orders right and completed in a timely manner. The introduction of new machines and recipes is done at a reasonable rate so that you don’t get overwhelmed trying to learn too many new things at once, reminding me of games like Overcooked."},
  {"name": "Alex Olney", "rating": "images/newImage/8star.png","date": "11.27.2023", "text": "SteamWorld Build Review: SteamWorld Build is a beautifully crafted game that seamlessly blends genres and ideas into a polished and premium package. There's not another management sim like it, but despite it running surprisingly well on Nintendo's system, it does leave us wanting for more reason to return to it. You're all but guaranteed to adore your first time through, but subsequent playthroughs may not carry the same magic. Still, with all that being said, this is undeniably a triumph of mechanical marvellousness."},
